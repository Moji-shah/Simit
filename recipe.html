    <h1>How to make a delicious Simit</h1>

          <strong>STEP 1</strong> <br />
          Tip the flour, salt and sugar into a bowl and mix together. Add the
          yeast and 150ml warm water, mix, then knead for a few mins to bring
          everything together into a soft dough. Tip onto your work surface and
          continue kneading for 10-12 mins until the dough feels stretchy.
          Return to a clean bowl, cover and leave to rise for an hour or two
          until doubled in size.

        <div class="col-6">
          <strong>STEP 2</strong> <br />
          Meanwhile, toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan until golden.
          Set aside in the pan. Mix the molasses syrup or pomegranate molasses
          with 50ml water in a wide shallow bowl.

          <strong>STEP 3</strong> <br />
          Divide the dough into four equal pieces. Roll each into a sausage
          about 45cm long. Flip the rope of dough back on itself then twist the
          two strands and loop into a ring, squeezing the ends together to
          secure. Once shaped, dip each piece into the molasses water, turning
          to coat, then into the sesame seeds, making sure each one is well
          covered. Transfer to a baking tray, cover and leave to prove for
          another 45 mins-1 hr. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.

          <strong>STEP 4</strong> <br />
          When the breads have puffed up, uncover them and bake for 15-18 mins
          until golden. Cool, then wrap in a tea towel to keep them fresh. Can
          be made up to a day ahead and warmed gently before serving.
